WARNING !!!

This file contains detailed info about the second option to install
InstantObjects, as per the Readme1st.txt file in the root of the
Project.

If you inadvertently skipped reading it, it should be a good thing
to do it now, before going on, in order to evaluate also the
first alternative.

There you will find other valuable information about the project.


INSTALLATION
------------

This tutorial is for newbie developers that want to install
InstantObjects in a simple way.

If you want a complete explanation of InstantObjects structure,
please refer to the installation section of \Doc\Readme.txt file.

If you want a quick installation process to evaluate InstantObjects,
you can use the two "standard" "borland project group" in the folder
for your Delphi/Kylix version under this Install folder.

For every Delphi version you can find:
- RunTimePackages to Build all of the "standard" run-time packages.
  - Open it and "BuildAll" projects.

- DesignTimePackages to Build/Install all of the "standard"
  design-time packages.
  - Open it and "Install" each package included.

"Standard" packages means that you can compile it with components included
in a standard Delphi installation. If you want to know how to install
other brokers to use third party data access components and technologies,
please refer to the installation section of \Doc\Readme.txt file.

NOTE TO DELPHI 2005 AND 2006 USERS:
We don't provide the .bdsproj files (as we don't provide
.dof and .cfg files for older versions of Delphi), so the
IDE will prompt you to create one of these files the first
time you open a package. At the prompt that asks whether to
make the package a Win32 or a .NET one, please answer Win32.

For example RunTimePackages.bpg for Delphi 7 contains:
--------------------------------
1) IOCore.dpk: InstantObjects Core Package
2) IOADO.dpk : ADO Broker
3) IOBDE.dpk : BDE Broker
4) IODBX.dpk : DBExpress Broker
5) IOIBX.dpk : IBX Broker
6) IOXML.dpk : XML Broker

For example DesignTimePackages.bpg for Delphi  7 contains:
--------------------------------
1) dclIOCore.dpk: InstantObjects Desing package
2) dclIOADO.dpk : ADO Broker
3) dclIOBDE.dpk : BDE Broker
4) dclIODBX.dpk : DBExpress Broker
5) dclIOIBX.dpk : IBX Broker
6) dclIOXML.dpk : XML Broker

When you are familiar with the packages and source structure of
InstantObjects you can setup and maintain your own personalised
bpg files to include only packages you want use.
