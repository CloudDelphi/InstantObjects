INSTALLATION
------------

This tutorial is for newbie developers that want to install
InstantObjects in a simple way.

If you want a complete explanation of InstantObjects structure,
please refer to the installation section of \Doc\Readme.txt file.

If you want a quick installation process to evaluate InstantObjects,
you can use the two "standard" "borland project group" in the folder
for your Delphi/Kylix version under this Install folder.

For every Delphi version you can find:
- RunTimePackages to Build all of the "standard" run-time packages.
  - Open it and "BuildAll" projects.

- DesignTimePackages to Build/Install all of the "standard"
  design-time packages.
  - Open it and "Install" each package included.

"Standard" packages means that you can compile it with components included
in a standard Delphi installation. If you want to know how to install
other brokers to use third party data access components and technologies,
please refer to the installation section of \Doc\Readme.txt file.

--------------------------------
1) IOCore.dpk: InstantObjects Core Package
2) IOADO.dpk : ADO Broker
3) IOBDE.dpk : BDE Broker
4) IODBX.dpk : DBExpress Broker
5) IOIBX.dpk : IBX Broker
