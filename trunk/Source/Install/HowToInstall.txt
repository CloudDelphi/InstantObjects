  - Open it and "BuildAll" projects.

- DesignTimePackages.bpg to Build/Install all of the "standard" design-time packages.
  - Open it and the first time "Install" every single packages included.

"Standard" packages means that you can compile it with components included in a standard Delphi istallation. If you want to know how install other brokers to use third party data access components and technologies, please refer to the installation section of \Doc\Readme.txt file.
