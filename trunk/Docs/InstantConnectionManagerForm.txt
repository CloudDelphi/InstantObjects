New InstantConnectionManager and InstantConnectionManagerForm
-------------------------------------------------------------

TInstantConnectionManagerForm was extracted from InstantConnectionManager.pas unit so the TInstantConnectionManager component is Forms independent.
Now the InstantConnectionManager.Execute method launch a procedure registered by a calling to RegisterConnectionManagerExecutor.
In the initialization section of InstantConnectionManagerForm.pas unit this procedure is called automatically.

Know problems and backward compatibility
----------------------------------------
for applications that uses the default manager (like the Primer demo) you must add InstantConnectionManagerForm in a uses section.

More flexibility
----------------
Now is possible to use a different form for a ConnectionManager component.
Build a new form and register it by RegisterConnectionManagerExecutor.
