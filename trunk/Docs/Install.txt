WARNING !!!

This file contains detailed info about the first option to install
InstantObjects, as per the Readme1st.txt file located in the root
folder of the project.

If you inadvertently skipped reading it, it should be a good thing
to do it now, before going on, in order to evaluate also the
second alternative.

There you will find other valuable information about the project.


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Unpack zip file to <installdir>


2. Add the following folders to your development environment's library path:

   <installdir>/Source/Core
   <installdir>/Source/Brokers/<brokername>

   Add a line for each broker you plan to use.
   If you are going to use a broker that needs a separate catalog
   (currently the IBX, UIB, DBX and ADO brokers), then
   you'll also need to add a line for each required catalog:

   <installdir>/Source/Catalogs/<catalogname>

   Here is a table of current broker-catalog dependencies:
   
   Broker              Depends on Catalog
   --------------------------------------
   IBX                 IBFb
   UIB                 IBFb
   DBX                 IBFb, MSSql
   ADO                 MSSql
   
   Other brokers have their catalogs integrated into themselves,
   so there are not dependency issues for them.


3. Build and install the InstantObjects core packages:

   <installdir>/Source/Core/<version>/IOCore.dpk (build)
   <installdir>/Source/Design/<version>/DclIOCore.dpk (install)
   
   Where <version> identifies your version of Delphi, Kylix or
   FPC. Examples: D5, D6, D7, K3, D2005, D2006, etc.


4. Build and install the desired catalog and broker package(s):

   For example, if you need the ADO broker:
   
   <installdir>/Source/Catalogs/MSSql/<version>/IOMSSqlCatalog.dpk (build)
   <installdir>/Source/Brokers/ADO/<version>/IOADO.dpk (build)
   <installdir>/Source/Brokers/ADO/<version>/DclIOADO.dpk (install)

   If you need a broker that doesn't depend on a catalog, just build and
   install the broker's packages. Here's an example for the XML broker:
   
   <installdir>/Source/Brokers/XML/<version>/IOXML.dpk (build)
   <installdir>/Source/Brokers/XML/<version>/DclIOXML.dpk (install)
   
   Please note that not all brokers are available in all versions
   of Delphi/Kylix/FPC. If you think you can make a supplied broker
   work in an unsupported version, or create a new broker from scratch
   then please contact us.
   
   NOTE TO DELPHI 5 USERS:
   dpk files in Delphi 5 have an additional suffix "_D5". This is
   because Delphi 5 does not support the LIBSUFFIX compiler directive
   that InstantObjects uses in newer versions of Delphi.
